# Video Game Exchange

This is an app for trading video games online.
It is built to introduce Level II students to gems using Devise as an example.
Students start with a prebuilt app and use Devise to add an authentication layer.

# Setting up the example app

There's a bootstrap script which can be run to setup the app.
Run this in the terminal:

```shell
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheFuturesFund/video-game-exchange-example/master/bin/bootstrap | bash
```

This will clone the app, cd into the directory, and create the database.
At this point, you should be ready to use `rails server` and checkout the example app.
